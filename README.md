# Stock Prediction using ARIMA model 

This project aims to predict the stock prices of a particular company using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## Overview

The program will download the dataset from Yahoo Finance, pre-process it, train the ARIMA model, and predict the stock prices. The predicted values will be plotted against the actual values to visualize the accuracy of the model.

The trained model has achieved a high accuracy of 97% in predicting the stock prices.
